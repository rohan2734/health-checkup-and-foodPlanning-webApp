## HealthifyMe - A Full Stack MERN Project

### **Overview**
HealthifyMe is a **full-stack web application** designed to help users find the right diet plans for various diseases. Instead of searching endlessly for food recommendations online, users can simply explore the app, filter diseases, and select diet plans tailored to their health conditions. Additionally, it offers a **cart and delivery system** for added convenience.

### **Technologies Used**
- **Frontend:** ReactJS, CSS, Bootstrap
- **Backend:** ExpressJS, NodeJS
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Deployment:** Heroku *(Currently facing deployment issue: `Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch`)*

### **Key Features**
- **Motivational Slogans** to encourage a healthier lifestyle.
- **Disease Search & Filtering** – Users can browse through **15+ diseases** and find relevant diet plans.
- **Food Plan Selection** – Users can select and filter **40+ diet plans** based on their needs.
- **Cart & Checkout System** – Users can add diet plans to their cart and proceed to checkout.
- **User Roles & Authorization** – 
  - **Normal Users** can search, filter, and purchase diet plans.
  - **Admins** can manage diseases, food plans, and order statuses via a dedicated dashboard.

### **What I Learned**
- Developed the entire **frontend, backend, and database**, improving my confidence in **MERN stack development**.
- Debugged and solved issues independently, enhancing my problem-solving skills.
- Learned to design and implement complex features such as **authorization, filtering, and admin functionalities**.
- Collaborated with my friend **Manish CP**, who helped with **data collection**, which I stored in MongoDB using Postman.
- Gained experience in handling full-stack development as a solo developer.

### **Challenges Faced & Solutions**
- **Updating Parent Component from Child:** Faced issues with state management but resolved it after refining React component interactions.
- **CORS Errors:** Identified and fixed attribute mismatches causing API request failures.
- **UI & Layout Issues:** Initially struggled with **Bootstrap** but improved after studying basic UI/UX principles.
- **Database Not Syncing to Frontend:** Debugged and fixed issues causing filtered products not to update.
- **Admin Dashboard & Authorization:** Implementing role-based access control was complex but successfully managed.
- **Form Input Not Updating:** Encountered minor state management issues, which were later fixed.

### **What Needs Improvement?**
- **UI/UX Design:** The frontend can be enhanced with better styling and user-friendly design.
- **User Verification:** Adding **email verification** or **Google login** can improve security.
- **Deployment Stability:** Fixing the **Heroku deployment issue** for a smooth live experience.
