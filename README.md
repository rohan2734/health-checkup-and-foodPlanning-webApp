## Technologies used
- It is a full Stack project developed using MERN stack - MongoDB ExpressJS ReactJS NodeJS .
- For frontend , I have used , ReactJS CSS bootstrap
- For backend , I have used , ExpressJS and NodeJS
- for Database, I have used MongoDB .
-
- website is deployed [here](https://healthify-me-rd.herokuapp.com/)
- currently due to this error `Error R10 (Boot timeout) -> Web process failed to bind to $PORT within 60 seconds of launch`, it is not deployed successfully.

## What are the things I have learnt? 
- I have done this during my Software engineering methodologies subject , and i have handled the frontend, backend and database
- Since I have handled frontend, backend and database alone, my confidence was increased.
- I was able to solve the errors on my own
- I was able to develop my own approaches to implement the features and was able to implement them successfully
- My friend Manish CP has helped me in the data collection and I have saved them with postman in the MongoDB database.

## what are thechallenges faced?
- I was facing problems in updating the parent component from child component, but I solved it finally
- I was facing issues in solving the CORS error , later i figured out that it was due to the attributes mismatch. 
- I was facing issues in the flexibiltiy, layout , which i solved later after studying about the bootstrap basics
- I was facing issues in filtering, searching, the products were not being updated from database to the frontend,  which i solved it later.
- authorisation and building admin dashboard, updating the categories , products from the interface was tough, 
- the forms input was sometimes not updating , it was fixed later.

## Features of the project 
- Slogans to motivate the users to have a healthier lifestyle
- Home page to view all the diseases
- search functionality to view all the diseases
- User can select the food plans after selecting the diseases and can also filter them
- After filtering the user can add them to the cart
- Proceed to checkout
- There are two types of users (admin, normal user)
- Authorisation has been implemented to check the role of the user 
- Admins can view the dashboard and can modify or add the food plans, diseases, and also can manage the status of the orders

## Overall Learnings
- I have learnt how to delegate the tasks, I was handling the whole project and I delegated documentation tasks to my friend
- I have learnt on how to build a product by myself alone.
- I have learnt on how to solve the errors on my own
- My confidence in MERN stack was improved a lot.

## what needs to be improved?
- CSS needs to be improved. It was my first project and i used bootstrap . I was not aware of UI UX design and CSS. So I have used the very basic CSS.
- verification of users can be added with email or Login with google can be implemented .
