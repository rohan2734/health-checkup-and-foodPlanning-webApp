This is an app which guides you take foodPlans to make your health better, you can aslo view the diseases and order the foodPlans , and this app delivers you the foodPlans also.

- website is deployed [here](https://healthify-me-rd.herokuapp.com/)

## What are the things I have learnt? 
- I have done this during my Software engineering methodologies subject , and i have handled the frontend, backend and database
- Since I have handled frontend, backend and database alone, my confidence was increased.
- I was able to solve the errors on my own
- I was able to develop my own approaches to implement the features and was able to implement them successfully
- My friend Manish CP has helped me in the data collection and I have saved them with postman in the MongoDB database.

## Features of the project 
- Slogans to motivate the users to have a healthier lifestyle
- Home page to view all the diseases
- search functionality to view all the diseases
- User can select the food plans after selecting the diseases and can also filter them
- After filtering the user can add them to the cart
- Proceed to checkout
- There are two types of users (admin, normal user)
- Authorisation has been implemented to check the role of the user 
- Admins can view the dashboard and can modify or add the food plans, diseases, and also can manage the status of the orders

## Overall Learnings
- I have learnt how to delegate the tasks, I was handling the whole project and I delegated documentation tasks to my friend
- I have learnt on how to build a product by myself alone.
- I have learnt on how to solve the errors on my own
- My confidence in MERN stack was improved a lot.

## what needs to be improved?
- CSS needs to be improved. It was my first project and i used bootstrap . I was not aware of UI UX design and CSS. So I have used the very basic CSS.
- verification of users can be added with email or Login with google can be implemented .
